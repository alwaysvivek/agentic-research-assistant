# Exercise 1 - FastAPI and PydanticAI

In this exercise, you get to work with fastapi to create APIs of different kinds. You'll get to know the simple patterns of CRUD in fastapi. Also you'll learn how to serve csv data, and serve machine learning models. You will also use pydanticai together with fastapi.

## 0. FastAPI glossary API

Read the data from this repository called `fastapi_glossary.json`. Create Pydantic model(s) of the data in a separate script called `data_processing.py`.

a) Now create an endpoint `/glossary` which will return all words and their meaning.

b) Create a query parameter to filter out a specific word

c) Turn your API into a CRUD API, so that you can add glossary, update and delete glossary.

d) Test out your API in Swagger UI.

e) Test out your API using requests inside of a Jupyter notebook or a separate Python script. Try the different request types.
